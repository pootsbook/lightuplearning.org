Light Up Learning is committed to fostering a community of learners, which includes its mentors as well as its students. Each mentor is supported by regular contact with other mentors and by the guidance and leadership teams within our partnership school.

To encourage our sense of the importance of learning about what you love, we also provide paid ‘LuL Time’ for our mentors – a period for the mentor to research and learn about what they, as individuals, are passionate about. We believe this enthusiasm is infectious, so not only do the mentors benefit from this freedom to explore; the students, too, will see the joy that comes from such exploration.
