Light Up Learning currently works in partnership with Lasswade High School, which helps us select our students and mentors.

Lasswade High School is an exciting place to work, having recently been rebuilt, boasting state of the art facilities, and with an ambitious Senior Leadership Team, willing to support our project. We ran a pilot in the school for a year and half, with remarkable results [link:results]. Now weâ€™re expanding within the school, bringing in new mentors and reaching more students. Eventually, we plan to move into other schools with a view to connect with as many students as we can.

If you would like Light Up Learning to work with a school in your community, we would love to hear from you! [link:contact]
