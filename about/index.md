Light Up Learning is a charitable organisation dedicated to inspiring a love of learning in young people.

We offer one-on-one mentoring to school students who are struggling to meet their potential or have become disengaged in the classroom. In particular we aim to reach those who would not otherwise be able to afford such extracurricular support.

We use the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, eligibility for The Lothians Equal Access Programme for Schools, and Free School Meals as our guidelines. Lasswade High School, our current partnership school, help us select our students.

Each mentor takes time to develop a strong relationship with his or her student, so that together they can explore topics that the student is naturally excited about in an open and enjoyable way. So far weâ€™ve seen everything from air crash investigation to Brazilian footballers!

We aim for our mentors and their students to work together for four years, all the way from S3 to the end of their time at school. This gives the students as much chance as possible to develop learning skills that can change their lives.
