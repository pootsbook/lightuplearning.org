## Vision

A society which celebrates individuality through learning

## Mission

Light Up Learning is all about inspiring a love of learning among young people in order to break through the barriers of social inequality.

We believe that doing what you love is the most natural way to pick up the invaluable skill of learning, and increase self­confidence. We aim to put power in the hands of those who often feel powerless by exploring what matters most to them ­ from films to footballers.

We are convinced that mentoring is done best when it is long term. This gives time to build trust and adapt to the students’ changing interests and needs.

Light Up Learning is a simple, effective way to give young people the start in life they deserve, and encourages a more equal society where people are free to celebrate their individuality.
