Our story really begins with two knobbly-kneed primary school pupils back in 1993. A young Richard McLauchlan and Will Ferguson were just a year apart, and knew each other from across the playground. But it wasn’t until 2010 that they actually exchanged words, when they both started their Masters degrees at Cambridge, this time with their knees concealed.

Staying on for Ph.D’s gave Will and Richard plenty of time to discuss their learning experiences. Richard found that studying what he loved made learning not just easier, but fun. Though Will was interested and challenged by his studies, he wanted to interact with a broader range of people than he was used to.

These experiences, combined with work for charitable organisations (The Access Project and The Sutton Trust), compelled Richard and Will to start a charity of their own, embodying their own specific values. And so Light Up Learning was born.

Our connection to Lasswade High School came through Richard’s brother, who was a teacher at a neighbouring Midlothian school. His colleague there, Graham Paris, was soon to move to Lasswade to become one of its Depute Headteachers. Having spoken to Graham about our idea, he asked us to accompany him to his new school, which proved a wonderful piece of timing.

Lasswade had recently been rebuilt, with an ambitious Senior Leadership Team, willing to support our project. We ran a pilot in the school for a year and half, with remarkable results [link:results]. Now we’re expanding within the school, bringing in new mentors and reaching more students. Eventually, we plan to move into other schools with a view to connect with as many students as we can.

Along the way, we’ve been building a community of individuals [link:bio] who share the LuL vision, from an American researcher to an Australian marketing specialist via a Northern Irish computer wizard. Together, we hope to make an impact that none of us alone could make. Perhaps you, too, could get involved [link:get-involved] and make your mark with us.
