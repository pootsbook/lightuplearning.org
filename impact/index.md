Light Up Learning has been working with its partnership school, Lasswade High, since February 2015. Our pilot period lasted from then until June 2016. Our success so far – whether that be in encouraging one student to stay on at school, instead of leaving early with few qualifications, or another student deciding to apply to university when he’d previously ruled this possibility out – has been one of the most thrilling aspects of the project. This success has provided good reasons for Lasswade continuing to support Light Up Learning within their community, encouraging us to take on more students at the school.

We have also received these kinds of responses from parents:

> “We are thrilled that through working with you we can see a noticeable difference in Aspen’s confidence of her own abilities, which is filtering into other aspects of her school and home life.”

> “Thomas was very keen to let me read his essay [on sports psychology, a topic of his choice that he had been working on with a LuL mentor] last night – and I must say I am very impressed with it. The other noticeable difference is that he is doing his homework! Twice this week he has stayed back at school to use the library facilities to complete homework tasks, so thank you for discussing time management with him. Thank you too for all that you’ve helped Thomas with this session. He really enjoys his sessions with you.”

And just before the previous headteacher left, we were amazed to read this message from him:

> “[T]his has been a fantastic programme and initiative and I can honestly say that in well over 10 years of Senior Leadership I can’t recall as positive feedback about this work as any other that I have been involved with… Lasswade are very fortunate to have your support and input.”
