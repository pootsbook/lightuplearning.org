## Thomas

When fifteen year­old rugby enthusiast Thomas first heard about the possibility of working with Light Up Learning, he said that he “didn’t really know what to expect”. He did think, though, that it could be “a good opportunity for me to reach new areas that I wasn’t really doing in other classes– because I wasn’t doing what I wanted to do”.

During a year of working with Richard, Thomas has developed what he calls the ability to “self­analyse, or self­teach”, which has had a positive effect both in and out of school.

“The way I’m learning”, he says, “is about something I enjoy, so taking that into something I don’t enjoy helps me do better”. Thomas thinks “I do analyse things a lot better than what I did”, and gives the example of a change of heart about politics. “I was telling him [Richard] how I find politics boring, but we talked about how if you look at political debates, in a sports way, like getting the upper hand, and getting more points, then it’s more easy to enjoy, and I thought it was brilliant”.

When we asked him if he could apply all of this to things outside the classroom, he said “Yes, definitely in decision­making. Even in my rugby, if I’ve analyzed a game or a part of a game, I’ll know… if I am making the right or wrong decision”. He even believes the results are obvious in the classroom, especially in his English and History classes.

Surveys and results show that Thomas’s academic performance has improved, and he is more confident pursuing his interests and meeting the challenges of school.

￼And what’s the best bit of working with Light Up Learning? For Thomas, “it’s mostly the freedom that I get to do what I want and learn what I want to learn”. Light Up Learning “opens up new doors which stay closed if I didn’t go”.

## Greig

Greig started working with Light Up Learning during the final year and a half of his time at Lasswade High School. This final stage of school was filled with the usual pressures that many young people his age face: taking exams and planning for the future, making choices about when, how, and what to focus his energy on.

He told us that his Light Up Learning sessions with Will provided much­needed ‘relief from school life… because… school can get quite stressful, and when you’ve got a period once a week where you can work on what you want and talk about what you want, it does help’.

An avid reader, Greig found that taking a deep dive into Science Fiction had ripple effects on his schoolwork. Critically analysing the books he was reading, he found that ‘because it’s something I enjoy, it’s a lot easier to do the analysis… we talk about why I liked it, what it did well and what it didn’t do well, and then we’d pull that together into thinking about how does that help me’. This process then had an effect on his studies; he found it ‘a lot easier to do schoolwork’ because he could ‘relate to it a lot more… I’m wanting to do it because I can get to grips with it and it’s something I can enjoy’.

During his eighteen months working with Light Up Learning, Greig noticed a number of changes in himself. Before, he mostly read teen Sci Fi, because he felt he couldn’t understand adult works, but because Will helped him to ‘get to grips with’ works like HG Wells’ _The Time Machine_, he now has the confidence to read them.

Greig also believes that his Light Up Learning sessions allowed him to become clearer on his plans for the future. ‘I used to want to do Chemistry’, he said, ‘but over our sessions I realised that… I like Geography a lot better, and that’s now the path I want to do’. During the course of his last year, Greig gained an unconditional offer to read Geography at Heriot Watt University, where he plans to go next year.

Asked to describe his relationship with Will in one word, Greig chose ‘different’, saying that it wasn’t ‘like any other sort of friendship’. He appreciated that Will treated him ‘equally’ and ‘really wants to know about what you know, like I’m the expert for a small bit’.

Greig thinks that his friends and other teenagers would benefit from the chance to spend fifty minutes a week on the subjects they love. ‘I have friends with good grades’, he said, ‘but who need a drive to do more’. It’s crucial, he thinks, ‘to understand them [teenagers] before telling them to do something. Like Will, he got to know me and it’s a lot easier then to interact once you’ve got to know them’.

## Daniel

A lover of all things sports­related, Daniel hopes to pursue a career coaching football. Over the course of his time with Light Up Learning, he has been surprised by his growing ability to research and write about what he’s most passionate about, particularly American sports. He says that during his sessions, he “usually writes a bit, and usually I hate writing, but I enjoy writing when I’m doing it with LuL.”

His work with Richard has helped him discover how to “break things down” and “learn in depth about new things.” Daniel has even reported an increased sense of self​­confidence when it comes to carrying out coursework in Maths and English in consequence.

More than anything else, Daniel sees Richard as a type of friend, someone he can have a laugh with and learn with at the same time. For Daniel’s mum, she’s just “so grateful Daniel had this opportunity because he really enjoyed coming to sessions”. LuL has even played a big part in his decision “to stay through S5 and likely S6.”

The reason is simple for Daniel: “It’s just a fun thing to do, it cheers me up, helps me learn at the same time. I really enjoy that a lot.”
