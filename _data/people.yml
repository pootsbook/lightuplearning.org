- name: Will Ferguson 
  role: Mentor and Trustee
  bio: "Will is originally from Edinburgh, and moved back there after an undergraduate degree at Harvard University and a Ph.D. in history at the University of Cambridge. During his studies, the combination of world­class teaching and handling rare historical documents made Will aware that learning could be thrilling and life­enhancing. He wanted to share this powerful sense of excitement with young people and, after a year of working as a voluntary mentor with The Access Project in London, founded Light Up Learning with his friend, Richard McLauchlan."
- name: Richard McLauchlan
  role: Mentor and Trustee
  bio: "Richard is also a native of Edinburgh. At school he was lucky to be taught by a teacher who fired his imagination and showed him what it was to love learning. This experience propelled him to degrees at the Universities of St Andrews and Cambridge, where he studied theology, completing a Ph.D. on the poet R.S. Thomas. Whilst at Cambridge, not only did Richard enjoy teaching undergraduates, but also working with the Sutton Trust, helping non­privileged young people discover the joy of studying poetry. Having finished his studies, he spent a year bagpiping on the streets of Cologne, and then returned to Scotland to establish Light Up Learning with Will."

Kieran has been taught by several inspirational teachers, who instilled in him a strong belief in the importance of lifelong learning.

- name: Daniela DiGiacomo
  role: Researcher
  bio: "Daniela DiGiacomo is originally from Southern California, though her heart finds its home away from home in the many European and Latin American cities in which she has studied and lived. In fact, Daniela met Richard and Will in one of those cities, while doing a Masters in Development Studies at Cambridge University. There, she became excited by the unbounded potential of learning when it involves a diverse mix of people being encouraged to pursue their own interests. Because of her experiences, Daniela decided to dedicate her working life to addressing educational inequality, and now supports teachers, helping them to foster a love of learning in young people from diverse backgrounds. Daniela loves to immerse herself in new places and meet new people; she has therefore worked in a variety of community programmes around the world. Daniela is currently completing a Ph.D. in Learning Sciences and Human Development at the University of Colorado, Boulder."
